# Legend of the Red Dragon
A text-based RPG adventure game written in Python as part of a 2-week high school project.

Run `adventuregamefinal.py` to start playing the game.

## Notes
* Pretty much all of the code is left unmodified from when the game was finalized in May 2017, along with all the (rather excessive) comments. 
* The `old` folder contains all of the older versions of the game. I had no idea that Git existed at the time, so I resorted to the rather painful method of saving the program as a new file with a different version number.
