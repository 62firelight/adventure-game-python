# Legend of the Red Dragon
A text-based RPG adventure game written in Python as part of a 2-week high school project.

Run `adventuregamefinal.py` to start playing the game.

Pretty much all of the code is left unmodified from when the game was finalized, along with all the (rather excessive) comments.
