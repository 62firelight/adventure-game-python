## Notes
* Pretty much all of the code is left unmodified from when the game was finalized in May 2017, along with all the (rather excessive) comments and the method of calling functions containing infinite loops inside an infinite loop.
* The `old` folder contains all of the older versions of the game. I had no idea that Git existed at the time, so I resorted to the rather painful method of saving the program as a new file with a different version number.
